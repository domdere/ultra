# ultra-htoml

HTOML is a much preferable config format than JSON, and YAML (its more well specced for things like strings etc...)

However its library support for haskell is a little skint, this lib provides some
parsing of the `htoml` types that is similar to `aeson` for JSON, as a bit of experiment
on ways to extract information from the htoml types.
